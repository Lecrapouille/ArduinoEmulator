# ü§ñ Arduino Emulator

Another Arduino emulator with its web interface for testing your `.ino` files without physical hardware or complex simulator. This tool allows you to test your Arduino code directly from your PC without any hardware setup, featuring an immediate human-machine interface to emulate GPIOs, communication. No complex wiring or physical setup required - just write your code and interact with virtual pins through a simple, direct web interface.

> **Note:** Currently supports Arduino Uno only (20 pins: D0-D13, A0-A5)

## üöÄ Usage

Compile the whole project as described in the next section.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Download, compile and run the web interface

From your Linux console, type the following lines:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Lecrapouille/ArduinoEmulator.git --recurse-submodules
make download-external-libs
make -j8
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Prepare your Arduino code (WIP)

Modify the `src/arduino_user.cpp` file to point to your `.ino` file:

```cpp
#include "../doc/examples/example.ino"  // Change this path
```

Compile again:

```bash
make -j8
```

You have several examples given in this [repo](https://github.com/arduino/arduino-examples) to test.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Launch the application

From your Linux console, launch the emulator:

```bash
./build/Arduino-Emulator
```

A message like this one, shall appear:

```bash
========================================
Arduino Emulator Web Interface
Server address: 0.0.0.0
Server port: 8080
Loop frequency: 100 Hz
Loop period: 10 ms
========================================
Starting server...
Server started successfully!
Open your browser at: http://localhost:8080
Press Ctrl+C to stop the server
========================================
```

See the command line option for more settings: port, address and frequency.

Alternatively, people with VSCode or Cursor IDE, can directly launch the debugger and run step by step the code.
You can modify the [launch](.vscode/launch.json) file.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Open the web interface

Open your browser at `http://localhost:8080`

The interface allows you to:

- **Start/Stop/Reset** the simulation.
- **View pin states** (mode, value, PWM).
- **Simulate inputs** by changing pin values (digital, analog).
- **Serial Monitor** to see program output.
- **Send data** to Serial, I2C, SPI.

## üåê Web Interface Details

The web interface provides multiple interactive panels to display the Arduino Uno states and interact with it. Let describe each panel.

### ‚èØÔ∏è Start, Stop and Reset buttons

![Start Screen](doc/pics/start.png)

The Arduino emulator starts in a stopped state. You need to:

- **Start**: Click to begin the simulation (runs `setup()` then `loop()` continuously)
- **Stop**: Pause the simulation (freezes the current state)
- **Reset**: Stop and reset all pin states to their initial values, then restart if it was running

### üéõÔ∏è Arduino Board

![Board View](doc/pics/board.png)

Displays the state of all pins (D0-D13, A0-A5) with:

- Visual indicators for HIGH/LOW states
- Pin mode badges (INPUT, OUTPUT, INPUT_PULLUP, INPUT_PULLDOWN, OUTPUT_OPEN_DRAIN)
- Real-time LED indicators for digital pins

> **Pedagogical Note:** For educational purposes, pins are only displayed and enabled in the interface if `pinMode()` has been explicitly called in your Arduino code. This teaches the importance of proper pin initialization, even for INPUT pins.

### üí° LED Indicators

![LED Indicators](doc/pics/led_indicators.png)

The LED indicators (D0-D13) provide visual feedback:

- **OFF**: Pin is LOW (0V)
- **ON**: Pin is HIGH (5V)
- **Variable brightness**: For PWM pins, the LED brightness varies proportionally to the PWM duty cycle (0-255)

### üìç GPIO Controls

![GPIO Controls](doc/pics/gpios.png)

Interactive toggles to simulate digital inputs:

- Emulate button presses and sensor readings.
- Only enabled for pins configured as INPUT with the `pinMode()` function.
- Disabled for OUTPUT pins or controlled by Arduino code (i.e. serial ...)

### ‚ö° PWM Controls

![PWM Controls](doc/pics/pwm.png)

Sliders for PWM-capable pins (D3, D5, D6, D9, D10, D11):

- Real-time PWM value display (0-255).
- Visual feedback on LED indicators.
- Monitor `analogWrite()` output.
- **Read-only**: Sliders are controlled by Arduino code and cannot be modified by the user.

### üìä Analog Inputs

![Analog Inputs](doc/pics/analog.png)

Sliders to simulate analog sensor readings (A0-A5):

- Range: 0-1023 (10-bit ADC).
- Real-time voltage display.
- Only enabled for pins used with `analogRead()`.

### üì° UART / Serial Monitor

![UART Terminal](doc/pics/uart.png)

Serial communication terminal:

- View all `Serial.print()` and `Serial.println()` output.
- Send data to the Arduino (simulates Serial input).
- Timestamped messages.
- Clear button to reset the terminal.

### üêõ Debug Console

![Debug Console](doc/pics/debug.png)

- Simulation status changes.

- Analog input changes.
- Error messages.
